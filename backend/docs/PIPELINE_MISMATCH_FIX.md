# Pipeline Mismatch Fix - Training vs Ensemble Evaluation

## 🔍 **Issues Identified**

The evaluation metrics were inconsistent between training pipeline and ensemble evaluation due to a critical pipeline mismatch in the DCT model.

### **DCT Model - Normalization Pipeline Mismatch**

**✅ Correct Training Pipeline:**
```python
# Training code uses L2 normalization
dct_features = tf.signal.dct(tf.expand_dims(latent_flat, 0), type=2, norm='ortho')[0]
dct_features = tf.math.l2_normalize(dct_features, axis=0)  # ← L2 normalization
```

**❌ Previous Ensemble Implementation:**
```python
# WRONG: Ensemble was using different normalization approaches
# First attempt: No normalization
# Second attempt: StandardScaler (based on misunderstanding)
```

**🔍 Root Cause:**
The ensemble DCT model preprocessing didn't exactly match the training pipeline normalization step.

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

### **Updated `dct_model.py`**

The DCT model now uses the **exact same preprocessing pipeline as training**:

```python
# Step 5: Apply DCT exactly as in training code
dct_features = tf.signal.dct(tf.expand_dims(latent_flat, 0), type=2, norm='ortho')[0]

# Step 6: Apply L2 normalization exactly as in training code  
dct_features = tf.math.l2_normalize(dct_features, axis=0)
```

## 🔄 **Pipeline Comparison**

### **Before (Mismatched):**
```
Training:  Image → SRM → Encoder → Flatten → DCT → L2_Normalize → Classifier
Ensemble:  Image → SRM → Encoder → Flatten → DCT → [Different/Missing] → Classifier
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ WRONG!
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
Training:  Image → SRM → Encoder → Flatten → DCT → L2_Normalize → Classifier  
Ensemble:  Image → SRM → Encoder → Flatten → DCT → L2_Normalize → Classifier
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^ CORRECT!
```

## 🧪 **Verification**

The pipeline now exactly matches your training code:

**Training Pipeline:**
```python
def process(path, label):
    # ... image loading and SRM filtering ...
    latent = encoder(filtered_img[tf.newaxis, ...], training=False)[0]
    latent_flat = tf.reshape(latent, [-1])
    dct_features = tf.signal.dct(tf.expand_dims(latent_flat, 0), type=2, norm='ortho')[0]
    dct_features = tf.math.l2_normalize(dct_features, axis=0)
    return dct_features, tf.cast(label, tf.int32)
```

**Ensemble Pipeline (Fixed):**
```python
def preprocess(self, image_path):
    # ... same image loading and SRM filtering ...
    latent = self.encoder(filtered_img[tf.newaxis, ...], training=False)[0]
    latent_flat = tf.reshape(latent, [-1])
    dct_features = tf.signal.dct(tf.expand_dims(latent_flat, 0), type=2, norm='ortho')[0]
    dct_features = tf.math.l2_normalize(dct_features, axis=0)  # ← NOW MATCHES!
    return np.expand_dims(dct_features.numpy(), axis=0)
```

## 📋 **Expected Results**

After this fix:

- **✅ Ensemble DCT models should now produce identical results to training pipeline**
- **✅ No more preprocessing inconsistencies**  
- **✅ Accurate evaluation metrics that match training performance**

## 🔧 **SRM Model Status**

The **SRM + CONV-AE + NA-VGG** pipeline was already correctly implemented and matches the expected preprocessing.

## ⚠️ **Key Insight**

The fundamental principle: **Inference preprocessing MUST exactly match training preprocessing** for neural networks to work correctly. Any deviation in normalization, scaling, or feature extraction will cause performance degradation.

The pipeline is now fixed to match your training implementation exactly!
